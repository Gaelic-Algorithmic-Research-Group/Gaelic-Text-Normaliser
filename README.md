### Scottish Gaelic Lexicon

The lexicon file is provided by Michael Bauer, Scottish Gaelic linguist, author and lead collaborator on the Am Faclaer Baeg SG dictionary. The lexicon is a reformatted version of the dictionary that makes use of Michael's extensive labelling of traditional 
Gaelic spellings and common misspellings. The resource is extremely vital for the success of the memory based approach. 

### Rules for Normalisation

The lexical and grammatical rules for normalisation were the result of collaboration between the project leader Dr Will Lamb and Baeur. Both Lamb and Bauer, as fluent Gaelic speakers and experienced proof readers, were able to provide the linguistic rules to be translated into python code. 

### Scottish Gaelic Part of Speech Tagger 

For further conditioning in the rule based approach, part of speech tags were necessary. The code and models for POS tagging is very kindly provided by Dr Loic. The scripts were altered slightly to work within the python object.
